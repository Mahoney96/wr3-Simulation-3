#### Wr3 Helo App Simulation

    - 


#### Database
- PostgresSQL
- Massive (req, res)


#### Server (Mid-point/controller for communication)
 - node.js ()
 - dotenv ()
 - massive (handles connection to our Heroku database)
 - express (need express when creating a restful api)
 - express-session (Handles creating user sessions/session in general)
 - bcryptjs (Makes us able to {Hash} our password)
    - bcrypt vs bcryptjs: 
        - bcrypt: only works on node, need further dependencies.
        - bcryptjs; works 

 #### Front-end (client-end)
 Dependencies:
    - express
    - axios (req, res)
    - react ()
    - massive (handles connection to our Heroku database)
